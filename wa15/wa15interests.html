      <h1 class="page-title">What inspires me.</h1>
      <p class="page-intro">
        I like paying attention to the visuals around me, and a lot of what I notice shows up in my work.
        These are a few of the things that inspire me and keep me creative.

          <h2>Travel</h2>
          <p>
            I love to travel and look at the visuals of different places. The visual identity of every
            place is important and you can learn a lot from different storefronts, signage, color palettes,
            and even packaging in other cities.
          </p>

          <h2>Fashion</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve always been into fashion, and I want to work in that space in the future. I pay attention
            to how brands style and present themselves because the visuals say so much without using words.
          </p>

          <h2>Design</h2>
          <p>
            I like design because it’s a big part of advertising. Layout, type, and color change how people
            feel about a brand, and I want to learn how to use those things in a simple and clean way.
          </p>

          <h2>Photography</h2>
          <p>
            I take a lot of photos because I like framing things and playing with color. It helps me think
            about mood and composition in design work too.
          </p>

          <h2>Cooking</h2>
          <p>
            I've always really enjoyed cooking but recently I've gained a new appreciation for the different
            styling, textures, and colors of food. There’s a lot of design in it, and I notice how food brands
            and restaurants can make things look appealing.
