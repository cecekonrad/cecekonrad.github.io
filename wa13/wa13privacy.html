    <h2>Reflection </h2>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>For this project, I created <em>Book Finder</em>, a simple web app that uses the Open Library API to search and display books. I chose this API because it is free, public, and does not require a key, making it easy to integrate. My goal was to design something clean and minimal while giving users control over their personal data.</p>

      <p>The user control feature I implemented is local-only favorites. When users save books, that data stays on their own device through localStorage instead of being uploaded anywhere online. I also added clear options to export the list as a JSON file or delete all saved favorites, so users can take or remove their data at any time.</p>

      <p>This feature gives people more agency than most apps, which usually store lists or profiles on external servers. Here, nothing leaves the user’s browser. I also included a separate privacy page that clearly explains what data is collected with search and how that determines what stays private.</p>

      <p>One challenge I faced was handling slow API responses. I solved this by adding timeout messages and empty-result feedback so users always understand what is happening on screen.</p>
